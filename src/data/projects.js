As staffing shortages intensified and shift work became more common, the need for a faster, more reliable system became urgent. Workers needed flexibility—the ability to browse shifts on their phones, apply quickly, and know immediately if they got the job. Organizations needed speed—the ability to post a shift, review applicants, and confirm hires without waiting days for callbacks. The opportunity wasn\'t just to digitize healthcare staffing—it was to rethink how workers and organizations connect in the first place.

If the web platform didn\'t provide enough information, organizations wouldn\'t hire. Additionally, healthcare staffing requires trust. Workers need to know the shift details, pay, and requirements upfront. Organizations need to verify certifications, confirm availability, and see work history.

I needed to design a system that balanced the speed and simplicity of swipe-based discovery with the depth of information sailors need to make confident decisions.
